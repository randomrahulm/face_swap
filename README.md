Face Swapping using InsightFace in Python

This project demonstrates how to perform face swapping using the InsightFace library in Python. InsightFace is an open-source deep learning face analysis toolbox, which includes face recognition, alignment, and other facial analysis tasks. In this project, we focus on face swapping, where we transfer facial features from one person to another person's face, creating a convincing and entertaining visual effect.
